# calculator

This is a project where I will apply all that I have learned in HTML, CSS, Javascript from the start of 
my journey up until this point.

In this project, I will build a calculator that contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators:
    1. add
    2. subtract
    3. multiply
    4. divide
